# Multimodal-deep-learning-and-ensembling-for-Lung-Cancer-detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting lung cancer by combining data from **Chest X-rays** , **CT scans** and **Clinical metadata** using a **multimodal deep learning approach**. The goal is to improve detection accuracy by fusing information from multiple medical imaging modalities and enhancing predictions using ensemble techniques.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- ðŸ“· **Multimodal Input**: Uses Chest X-rays, CT scans and the metadata .
- ðŸ§  **Deep Learning Models**: Incorporates pre-trained models like EfficientNet, ResNet, Inception and Densenet.
- ðŸ”€ **Ensemble Learning**: Combines predictions from multiple models to boost performance.
- ðŸ’¡ **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Visual explanations of model predictions using Grad-CAM.
- ðŸ“Š **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
